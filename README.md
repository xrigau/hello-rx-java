Hello RxJava!
===

This is just a project for me to start getting familiar with RxJava. It'll probably contain mistakes, but I'll try to keep improving it as I learn about Reactive programming!

For now I just took the [renderscripting](https://github.com/xrigau/renderscripting) example I published some time ago and converted it to Rx.

My plan is to keep evolving this project as I learn moar stuff!
